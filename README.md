# Discourse-component-that-displays-a-quote-and-joke

Discourse is one of the most popular and flexible online forum platforms. In addition to offering rich functionality out of the box, it has a powerful Theme Components system , through which we can easily add new visual elements and dynamic features.

Create a custom component that displays a quote of the day and a funny joke on the forum homepage. This is a great way to add a personal touch , make users smile as soon as they log in, and create a positive atmosphere.
